# Launchme
## _Getting up of the sofa is no longer needed_

Launch.me is a game launcher with the objective of simply gathering all the games in your PC, with a simple interface and interactions with each game stores.

The launch.me was created with the purpose of learning Electron.JS and Vue, two incredible JS frameworks. Such code is not intended to be fully optimized or have the best coding and versioning practices. 

You can clone the project and run it locally, with Node.JS:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
